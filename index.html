        <h1> Welcome to Cody's Programming Portfolio! </h1>
        <p> Nice to meet you! This is the first website I've ever coded! This website has three pages.
            Right now you are on the home page. There is also a "Javasripts" page, which has links to my Javascript pages.
            Finally, there is an "About Me" page which has more information about me.
